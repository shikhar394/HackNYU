# Text to speech  
Uses the google text to speech module to bring life to text. This is the voice of VoiceHover. Written in Python.
It keeps running in the background waiting for the text file "talk.txt" to be created by the HoverKeyboard implemented in Processing. Once the HoverKeyboard creates the file, it is read by the python script and then deleted so another file can be accepted from the HoverKeyboard.
